Try to put your research in a broader context and explain why it is relevant and important. Give examples of what a master thesis in this area might enable the students to do in the future and try to share your enthusiasm about the subject.

Maybe you haven't experienced all theses situations, but you surely know what it is about and how it affect people's lives. 

Mobility of people and availability of goods is a fundamental part of the modern society and generates tremendous economic and social value. However, growing transport volumes pose challenges such as climate change, environmental pollution and traffic accidents.

The profile includes two highly interrelated areas, reflecting two main perspectives, where researchers meet to jointly develop multidisciplinary research, education and innovation. These areas are demand for transport and logistics and supply of transport and logistics

So, we address these Sustainable Development Goals: 


SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure
Redefining urban development strategies for effective and efficient future mobility solutions.
Investigating the role of new technology for making goods transport more efficient.

SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities   

Virtual multimodal infrastructure for smart cities, providing more reliable and responsive transportation services, and thus improving the lives of urban dwellers.
Development of an electrical ferry, contributing to reduced pollution in cities.
A common framework of concepts and methods to investigate how sustainable modes of individual, non-motorized and collective motorized mobility have come into conflict with modern car-dominated urban city planning and traffic engineering.
Enabling cities/municipalities to evaluate the different scenarios of a mixed vehicular traffic and their impact on traffic safety and efficiency.
Researching the transition to sustainable business practices for retailing and transport as well as to sustainable consumer behaviour.

- Assessing **trip chaining** to access **pickup points** - **customer** as an **active agent** in urban logistics solutions

- The impacts of **Dark kitchens and on-demand delivery** regarding (i) **inequalities of access to food products** in urban areas; (ii) pressures on the **urban structure and quality of life**; (iii) **labour precarization**
      
- Understanding how the **accessibility of logistics facilities for Last-mile delivery** 
can contribute to **equitable access to goods**. We can focus on **food systems** and explore central places theory (Christaller, 1966) 

- **Measuring** the **impacts** of **local production and consumption** arrangements on **social justice**. Would you be interested in exploring **Urban Agriculture**?

- Characterization and diagnosis of **home delivery demand** - Let's investigate the decision process through **causal relationships** among **urban structure** elements, **customer profile, residence/work location, and willingness to collect** products in collection sites.
